Hi. I'm Fred, an architect living in Texas.

During the day I spend my time working for a large financial company as an architect helping meet business needs through the application of technology. Outside of work I spend my time working towards my PhD in Computer Information Science at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. 

## Currently working on
- [ADGTK](https://github.com/fred78108/adgtk) a toolkit for exploring synthetic data generation with agentic systems.
